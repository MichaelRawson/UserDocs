<H2> What is Automated Theorem Proving?  </H2>
</CENTER>

<P>
<B>Automated Theorem Proving</B> (ATP) deals with the development of computer
programs that show that some statement (the <EM>conjecture</EM>) is a
<EM>logical consequence</EM> of a set of statements (the <EM>axioms</EM> 
and <EM>hypotheses</EM>).
ATP systems are used in a wide variety of domains. For examples, a mathematician
might prove the conjecture that groups of order two are commutative, from
the axioms of group theory; a management consultant might formulate axioms
that describe how organizations grow and interact, and from those axioms
prove that organizational death rates decrease with age; a hardware developer
might validate the design of a circuit by proving a conjecture that describes
a circuit's performance, given axioms that describe the circuit itself;
or a frustrated teenager might formulate the jumbled faces of a Rubik's
cube as a conjecture and prove, from axioms that describe legal changes
to the cube's configuration, that the cube can be rearranged to the solution
state. All of these are tasks that can be performed by an ATP system, given
an appropriate formulation of the problem as axioms, hypotheses, and a
conjecture.
<P>
The <B>language</B> in which the conjecture, hypotheses, and axioms
(generically known as <EM>formulae</EM>) are written is a logic, often 
classical 1st order logic, but possibly a non-classical logic and possibly 
a higher order logic. 
These languages allow a precise formal statement of the necessary 
information, which can then be manipulated by an ATP system.
This formality is the underlying strength of ATP: there is no ambiguity
in the statement of the problem, as is often the case when using a natural
language such as English. Users have to describe the problem at hand precisely
and accurately, and this process in itself can lead to a clearer understanding
of the problem domain. This in turn allows the user to formulate their
problem appropriately for submission to an ATP system.
<P>
The <B>proofs</B> produced by ATP systems describe how and
why the conjecture follows from the axioms and hypotheses, in a manner
that can be understood and agreed upon by everyone, even other computer
programs. The proof output may not only be a convincing argument that the
conjecture is a logical consequence of the axioms and hypotheses, it often
also describes a process that may be implemented to solve some problem.
For example, in the Rubik's cube example mentioned above, the proof would
describe the sequence of moves that need to be made in order to solve the
puzzle.
<P>
<B>ATP systems</B> are enormously powerful computer programs, capable
of solving immensely difficult problems. Because of this extreme capability,
their application and operation sometimes needs to be guided by an expert
in the domain of application, in order to solve problems in a reasonable
amount of time. Thus ATP systems, despite the name, are often used by domain
experts in an interactive way. The interaction may be at a very detailed
level, where the user guides the inferences made by the system, or at a
much higher level where the user determines intermediate lemmas to be proved
on the way to the proof of a conjecture. 
There is often a synergetic relationship between ATP system users and the 
systems themselves:
<UL>
<LI> The system needs a precise description of the problem written in 
     some logical form,
<LI> the user is forced to think carefully about the problem in order to 
     produce an appropriate formulation and hence acquires a deeper 
     understanding of the problem,
<LI> the system attempts to solve the problem,
<LI> if successful the proof is a useful output,
<LI> if unsuccessful the user can provide guidance, or try to prove some 
     intermediate result, or examine the formulae to ensure that the 
     problem is correctly described,
<LI> and so the process iterates.
</UL>

ATP is thus a <B>technology</B> very suited to situations where a clear thinking domain expert 
can interact with a powerful tool, to solve interesting and deep problems. 
Potential ATP users need not be concerned that they need to write an ATP system themselves; there 
are many ATP systems readily available for use. 
Some well known and successful systems are listed in 
<A HREF="https://tptp.org/cgi-bin/SystemOnTPTP">this interface</A> for users 
to try out many ATP systems.
For examples of problems written in classical 1st order logic, the 
<A HREF="https://tptp.org/">TPTP World</A> is a useful resource.
<P>
<B>Fields</B> where ATP has been successfully used include logic, mathematics, computer science, 
engineering, and social science; some outstanding successes are described below. 
There are potentially many more fields where ATP could be used, including biological sciences, 
medicine, commerce, etc. 
The technology is waiting for users from such fields.

<H2> What has Automated Theorem Proving been Really Useful for?</H2>
</CENTER>

Many significant problems have been, and continue to be, solved using ATP.
The fields where the most notable successes have been achieved are mathematics, software creation 
and verification, and hardware verification, and knowledge based systems.
<P>
The most exciting recent success in <B>mathematics</B> has been the settling of the Robbins 
problem by the ATP system <A HREF="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/AR/eqp/">EQP</A>.
In 1933 Herbert Robbins conjectured that a particular group of axioms form a basis for Boolean 
algebra, but neither he nor anyone else (until the solution by EQP) could prove this. 
The proof that confirms that Robbins' axioms are a basis for Boolean algebra was found October 10, 
1996, after about 8 days of search by EQP, on an RS/6000 processor. 
This result was reported in the <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/1210math.html">
New York Times</A>.
<P>
In the mathematical domain of quasi-groups there have been several successes using ATP systems. 
Otter has been used by the mathematician Ken Kunen to prove several results in quasi-groups. 
Fujita, Slaney, and Bennett (the first two being ATP researchers, the last a mathematician) 
decided many quasi-group problems using a system built at ICOT in Japan. 
William McCune and colleagues have <A HREF="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/AR/new_results/">used 
Otter to</A> find minimal axiom sets, find new single axioms, and solve other interesting 
problems, in a range of algebraic structures. 
The ATP system Waldmeister has been embedded into 
<A HREF="http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathematica/newin6/content/EquationalTheoremProving/">
Mathmatica</A>, extending Mathematica's already uniquely powerful algebraic theorem-proving 
capabilities.
ATP has been used at Charles University to cross-verify the 
<A HREF="http://mizar.org/">Mizar Mathematical Library</A>.
In the higher order setting 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/NuPrl/nuprl.html">NUPRL</A>
helped to confirm Higman's lemma and Gerard's paradox, both of which were under active 
investigation by humans at the time. 
The specialist geometry prover <A HREF="http://www.cs.twsu.edu/~chou/ge.html">Geometry Expert</A>,
of Chou, Gao, and Zhang, has been used to obtain new results in Euclidean geometry.
<P>
<b>Software creation</b> is an economically important real world application of ATP. 
Although the use of ATP in software creation is in its infancy, there have already been some 
interesting results. 
The <a href="http://www.kestrel.edu/HTML/prototypes/kids.html">KIDS</a> system developed at 
Kestrel Institute has been used to derive scheduling algorithms that have outperformed currently 
used algorithms. 
KIDS provides intuitive, high level operations for transformational development of programs from 
specifications. 
The <A HREF="http://ic.arc.nasa.gov/ic/projects/amphion/">Amphion</a> project, sponsored by NASA, 
is used to determine appropriate subroutines to be combined to produce programs for satellite 
guidance. 
By encapsulating usable functionality in software components (e.g., subroutines, object classes), 
and then reusing those components, Amphion can develop software of greater functionality in less 
time than human programmers, with some assurance that the overall system is correct because it 
is built up from trusted components
The <A HREF="http://ase.arc.nasa.gov/projects/certifiableSyn/">Certifiable Synthesis</A> project 
at NASA goes even further, generating code with annotations that can be used to extract ATP 
problems whose solution ensures various safety properties of the code.
<P>
<B>Software verification</B> is an obvious and attractive goal, which is slowly being realized 
using ATP technology. 
Three examples are given here, while many more are indexed at the 
<A HREF="http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/archive/formal-methods.html">
Formal Methods page</A>.
The <A HREF="http://i11www.ira.uka.de/~kiv/KIV-KA.html">Karlsruhe Interactive Verifier</A> (KIV) 
was designed as an experimental platform for interactive program verification at the University 
of Karlsruhe, and has since been used to successfully verify a range of software applications.
These include some case studies of academic software, e.g., implementation od set functions, tree 
and graph representation and manipulation, and verification of a Prolog to WAM compiler. 
The <A HREF="http://www.key-project.org/">KeY Project</A> in Europe integrates formal software 
specification and verification into the industrial software engineering processes. 
The starting point is a commercial CASE tool, which is augmented by capabilities for formal 
specification and verification. 
The ultimate goal is to make the verification process transparent for the user with respect to 
the informal object-oriented model.
<A HREF="http://pvs.csl.sri.com/">PVS</A> is a verification system that has been used in various 
applications, including diagnosis and scheduling algorithms for fault tolerant architectures, and
requirements specification for portions of the space shuttle flight control system.
<A HREF="http://www.eschertech.com/">Escher Techologies</A> is a company that researches, develops 
and delivers tools for the efficient construction of provably correct software for 
mission-critical, business-critical or safety-critical systems.
<P>
<B>Hardware verification</B> is the largest industrial application of ATP. 
IBM, Intel, and Motorola are among the companies that employ ATP technology for verification. 
A few good examples of the use of ATP systems for hardware verification are listed here, while 
many more are indexed at the <A HREF="http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/archive/formal-methods.html">
Formal Methods page</A>. 
The <A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/">ACL2</A> system has been used to obtain 
a proof of the correctness of the floating point divide code for AMD's PENTIUM-like AMD5K86 
microprocessor, while ANALYTICA has been used to verify a division circuit that implements the
floating point standard of IEEE. 
<A HREF="http://pvs.csl.sri.com/">PVS</A> (mentioned above in the context of software verification) 
has been used to verify a microprocessor for aircraft flight control. 
The RRL system has verified commercial size adder and multiplier circuits. 
The <A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/HVG/HOL/">HOL</A>
system has been used at Bell Laboratories for hardware verification. 
<A HREF="http://www.cli.com/software/nqthm/">Nqthm</A>
has been used to produce a mechanical proof of correctness of the FM9001
microprocessor.
<A HREF="http://www.jasper-da.com/">Jasper Design Automation, Inc</A> is a 
company with a mission of making full formal IC verification a competitive 
advantage for its customers.
The company’s flagship product, JasperGold Verification System, is the first 
verification product to deliver systematic complete verification, and
accomplishes this task within predictable, finite schedule constraints.
