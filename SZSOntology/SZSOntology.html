<H1 ALIGN=CENTER> SZS Ontology </H1>

The SZS ontologies (named after the authors of the original paper describing the success ontology 
[<A HREF="http://tptp.org/cgi-bin/SeeTPTP?Category=BibTeX&File=SZS03">SZS03</A>,
 <A HREF="http://tptp.org/cgi-bin/SeeTPTP?Category=BibTeX&File=SZS04">SZS04</A>,
 <A HREF="http://tptp.org/cgi-bin/SeeTPTP?Category=BibTeX&File=Sut08-KEAPPA">Sut08</A>]
provide status values to describe logical data. 
The SZS <EM>success</EM> ontology provides status values to describe what is known or has been 
successfully established about the relationship between the axioms and conjectures in logical data. 
The SZS <EM>no-success</EM> ontology provides status values to describe why a Success Ontology 
value has not been established. 
The SZS <EM>dataform</EM> ontology provides status values to describe the nature of logical data. 
All status values are expressed as <TT>OneWord</TT> to make system output parsing simple, and also 
have a three letter mnemonic.
In the figures below many of the "<TT>OneWord</TT>" status values are abbreviated - see the list 
below for the official full "<TT>OneWord</TT>"s. 
The lines in the ontologies can be followed up the hierarchy as "isa" links, e.g., an 
<TT>EquivalentTheorem</TT> (<TT>ETH</TT>) isa <TT>Equivalent</TT> (<TT>EQV</TT>) isa 
<TT>Satisfiable</TT> (<TT>SAT</TT>) and isa <TT>SatisfiableAxiomsTheorem</TT> (<TT>STH</TT>).

<H3> Commonly Used Ontology Values </H3>

The ontologies are very fine grained ontology, which have more status values and dataforms than are 
commonly used by ATP systems. 
Suitable subsets for practical purposes are as follows:
<UL>
<LI> For <TT>Success</TT>
     <UL>
     <LI> For problems with conjectures - report <TT>Theorem</TT> or <TT>ContradictoryAxioms</TT> 
          or <TT>CounterSatisfiable</TT>
     <LI> For problems without conjectures - report <TT>Satisfiable</TT> or <TT>Unsatisfiable</TT>
     </UL>
<LI> For <TT>NoSuccess</TT>
     <UL>
     <LI> System stopped due to CPU limit - report <TT>Timeout</TT>
     <LI> System gave up due to incompleteness - report <TT>GaveUp</TT>
     <LI> System stopped due to an error - report <TT>Error</TT>
     </UL>
<LI> For Dataforms
     <UL>
     <LI> A generic proof - report <TT>Proof</TT>
     <LI> A CNF refutation - report <TT>CNFRefutation</TT>
     <LI> A generic model - report <TT>Model</TT>
     <LI> A finite model - report <TT>FiniteModel</TT>
     <LI> An infinite model - report <TT>InfiniteModel</TT>
     <LI> A saturation - report <TT>Saturation</TT>
     </UL>
</UL>

Success ontology values are also used in TPTP format proofs to record the relationship between 
the parents and inferred formula of each inference step.
Commonly used values are:
<UL>
<LI> The inferred formula is a theorem of the parents (logical consequences, e.g., resolvants, 
     etc.) - report <TT>Theorem</TT>
<LI> The inferred and parent formulae are equisatisfiable (e.g., Skolemization) - report 
     <TT>EquiSatisfiable</TT>
<LI> The negation of the inferred formula is a theorem of the parents (e.g., negating the 
     conjecture in a proof by refutation) - report <TT>CounterTheorem</TT>
</UL>

<H3> Standard Presentation of Ontology Values </H3>

The solution status should be reported exactly once, in a line starting 
"<TT>%&nbsp;SZS&nbsp;status</TT>" (the leading '<TT>%</TT>' makes the line into a TPTP language 
comment). 
For examples:
<PRE>
    % SZS status Unsatisfiable for SYN075+1

    % SZS status GaveUp for SYN075+1
</PRE>

A success or no-success ontology value should be presented as early as possible, at least before 
any data output to justify the value. 
The justifying data should be reported exactly once, delimited by lines starting 
"<TT>%&nbsp;SZS&nbsp;output&nbsp;start</TT>" and "<TT>%&nbsp;SZS&nbsp;output&nbsp;end</TT>".
For example:
<PRE<
    % SZS output start CNFRefutation for SYN075-1
      ...
    % SZS output end CNFRefutation for SYN075-1
</PRE>

All "<TT>%&nbsp;SZS</TT>" lines can optionally have software specific information appended, 
separated by a <TT>:</TT>. 
For examples:
<PRE>
    % SZS status GaveUp for SYN075+1 : Could not complete CNF conversion

    % SZS output end CNFRefutation for SYN075-1 : Completed in CNF conversion
</PRE>

<H3> The <TT>Success</TT> Ontology </H3>

The ontology assumes that the input is a 2-tuple of the form &lt;<EM>Ax</EM>,<EM>C</EM>&gt;,
where <EM>Ax</EM> is a set (conjunction) of axioms and <EM>C</EM> is a set (conjunction) of 
conjectures.
This is a common standard usage of ATP systems (often there is only a single conjecture). 
If the input does not have any conjectures, e.g., a set of axioms, then the set (conjunction)
of formulae are used to form <EM>C</EM> and the 2-tuple is &lt;TRUE,<EM>C</EM>&gt;. 
The ontology values are based on the possible relationships between the sets of models of 
<EM>Ax</EM> and <EM>C</EM>.

<H3> The <TT>NoSuccesss</TT> Ontology </H3>

In order to understand and make productive use of a lack of success, it is necessary to precisely 
specify the reason for and nature of the lack of success. 
The SZS no-success ontology provides status values for describing the reasons. 
Note that no-success is not the same as failure: failure means that the software has completed 
its attempt to process the logical data and could not establish a success ontology value. 
In contrast, no-success might be because the software is still running, or that it has not yet 
even started processing the logical data.
